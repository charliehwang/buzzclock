Buzz Clock -- A Silent Clock for the iPhone
==========


About
-----

**[Buzz Clock](http://buzzclockapp.com)** is a simple, discreet way to tell the
time -- even when you can't take your phone out of your pocket. In interviews,
on first dates, in church, or at school plays, **Buzz Clock** silently vibrates
at set intervals, so you'll always know what time it is.

This distribution includes all the source code, images and metadata that went
into **Buzz Clock**'s App Store submission. It uses Xcode and requires SDK 3.0
or above.

Caveat
------

This is my first iPhone/Cocoa/Objective C/Xcode/Mac-based application, and it
undoubtedly has bugs, non-idiomatic usage and more than the usual complement
of stupidities and mistakes.  If you're using it to learn how to build an
iPhone app, please use it carefully.  If you're using it as an example of
common mistakes people make while building iPhone apps, please let
[me](mailto:greg@eod.com) know what needs correcting.
