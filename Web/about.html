    <span class="name">Buzz Clock</span> is a simple, discreet way to tell the time &mdash; even when you can&apos;t take your phone out of your pocket. In interviews, on first dates, in church, or at school plays, <span class="name">Buzz Clock</span> silently vibrates at set intervals, so you&apos;ll always know what time it is.
   </p>
   <p class="head">
    Instructions
   </p>
   <p>
    To use <span class="name">Buzz Clock</span>, just set an &ldquo;Interval&rdquo; and tap &ldquo;Done&rdquo; to return to the main screen. Your phone will now vibrate at that interval, with three fast, attention-getting buzzes followed by a number of slow buzzes indicating the time. For instance, with the &ldquo;Interval&rdquo; set to &ldquo;15 Minutes,&rdquo; half-past the hour would be announced with three fast buzzes followed by two slow buzzes. Three fast buzzes alone mark the top of the hour.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can press the Sleep/Wake button on the top of your phone to blank the screen &mdash; or simply wait a few minutes for it to blank itself &mdash; and <span class="name">Buzz Clock</span> will continue to work. As long as the program is running, you&apos;ll continue to get buzzed.

    Troubleshooting
   </p>
   <p>
    <span class="ques">I&apos;m not getting buzzed. Why?</span>
    <br />
    You need to have your iPhone set to allow vibration, controlled via the <span class="navi">Setup &#9654; Sounds</span> settings.
   </p>
   <div id="navi"></div>
   <p>
    Depending on the position of your Silent/Ring switch &mdash; the small, two-position switch on the side of your phone, next to the volume control &mdash; your phone may not be able to vibrate. Change the settings as appropriate, and <span class="name">Buzz Clock</span> will act as expected.
